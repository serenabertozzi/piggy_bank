Summary
---------
This is an exercise I did for Makers Academy, during the first week, to learn RSpec.
The Piggy Bank can store coins, be shaken and be broken.

**User Stories:**
```
As a user,
So that I can save money
I can put coins in my piggy bank

As a user,
So that I know whether there are coins in my piggy bank
I can shake it, and it will “cling” if there is money in it

As a user,
So I can enjoy my hard earned savings
I can break my piggy bank* and get back the number or coins that I had put in
```
